**Caveats**: `jacquard sim` drives the design from a static input waveform (e.g. VCD); for reactive testbenches use `jacquard cosim`. Storage must be **edge-triggered flip-flops** — *latches* (level-sensitive storage) are not supported. Asynchronous **set/reset on flip-flops is fine** (async reset is *not* the restriction); what's excluded is latch-based / level-sensitive sequential logic.

**Dataset**: Some (namely, netlists after AIG transformation in Steps 1-2 below, and reference VCDs) input data is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M42vFoVZhG4ZjyD1hqYD0Hrw8F1rwNXd?usp=drive_link) .

## Step 0. Download the AIG Process Kit
Go to [aigpdk](./aigpdk) directory where you can download `aigpdk.lib`, `aigpdk_nomem.lib`, `aigpdk.v`, and `memlib_yosys.txt`. You will need them later in the flow.

Before continuing, make sure your design's logic storage is edge-triggered
flip-flops — a raw latch left in the gate-level logic is rejected (async
set/reset on flip-flops is fine; async reset is not the restriction). Two
structured latch uses are still supported: **clock gates** map to the `CKLNQD`
integrated clock-gating cell — replace any RTL clock gates manually with
`CKLNQD` instantiations from `aigpdk.v` — and **latch-based register files /
memory** are captured by the memory-synthesis step below (`memory_libmap` →
RAM), not left as raw latches.
Also, you are advised to be familiar with where memory blocks (e.g., caches) are implemented in your design so you can check that the memory blocks are mapped correctly later.

## Step 1. Memory Synthesis with Yosys
This step makes use of the open-source [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) synthesizer to recognize and map the memory blocks automatically.

Download and compile the latest version of Yosys. Then run yosys shell with the following synthesis script.

``` tcl
# replace this with paths to your RTL code, and add `-I`, `-D`, `-sv` etc when necessary
read_verilog xx.v yy.v top.v

# replace TOP_MODULE with your top module name
hierarchy -check -top TOP_MODULE

# simplify design before mapping
proc;;
opt_expr; opt_dff; opt_clean
memory -nomap

# map the rams
# point -lib path to your downloaded memlib_yosys.txt
memory_libmap -lib path/to/memlib_yosys.txt -logic-cost-rom 100 -logic-cost-ram 100
```

The `memory_libmap` command will output a list of RAMs it found and mapped.

- If you see `$__RAMGEM_SYNC_` (naming inherited from GEM), it means the mapping is successful.
- If you see `$__RAMGEM_ASYNC_`, it means this RAM is found to have asynchronous READ port. You need to confirm if it is the case.
  - If it is a synchronous one but accidentally recognized as asynchronous, you might need to patch the RTL code to fix it. There might be multiple reasons it cannot be recognized as synchronous. For example, [when the read and write clocks are different](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/issues/4521).
  - If it is indeed asynchronous, check its size. If its size is very small and affordable to be synthesized using registers and mux trees (which is *very* expensive for large RAM banks), you can remove the `$__RAMGEM_ASYNC_` block in `memlib_yosys.txt`, re-run Yosys to force the use of registers.
- If you see `using FF mapping for memory`, it means the memory is recognized, but due to it being nonstandard (e.g., special global reset or nontrivial initialization), Jacquard will fall back to registers and mux trees. If the size of the memory is small, this is usually not an issue. Otherwise, you are advised to try other implementations.

After a successful mapping, use the following command to write out the mapped RTL as a single Verilog file.
``` tcl
write_verilog memory_mapped.v
```

Check the correctness of this step by simulating `memory_mapped.v` with your reference CPU simulator.

## Step 2. Logic Synthesis
This step maps all combinational and sequential logic into a special set of standard cells we defined in `aigpdk.lib`.
The quality of synthesis is directly tied to Jacquard's final performance, so we suggest you use a commercial synthesis tool like DC. You can also use Yosys to complete this if you do not have access to a commercial synthesis tool.

Check the correctness of this step by simulating `gatelevel.gv` with your reference CPU simulator.

### Use Synopsys DC
First, you need to compile `aigpdk.lib` to `aigpdk.db` using Library Compiler.

With that, you synthesize the `memory_mapped.v` obtained before under `aigpdk.db`.

Some key commands you may use on top of your existing DC flow:

``` tcl
# change path/to/aigpdk.db to a correct path. same for other commands.
set_app_var link_path path/to/aigpdk.db
set_app_var target_library path/to/aigpdk.db
read_file -format db $target_library

# elaborate TOP_MODULE
# current_design TOP_MODULE

# timing settings like create_clock ... are recommended. Jacquard benefits from timing-driven synthesis.

compile_ultra -no_seq_output_inversion -no_autoungroup
optimize_netlist -area

write -format verilog -hierarchy -out gatelevel.gv
```

### Use Yosys: Example script
``` tcl
# if you exited Yosys in step 2, you can read back in your memory_mapped.v yourself.
# read_verilog memory_mapped.v
# hierarchy -check -top TOP_MODULE

# synthesis
synth -flatten
delete t:$print

# change path/to/aigpdk_nomem.lib to a correct path. same for other commands.
dfflibmap -liberty path/to/aigpdk_nomem.lib
opt_clean -purge
abc -liberty path/to/aigpdk_nomem.lib
opt_clean -purge
techmap
abc -liberty path/to/aigpdk_nomem.lib
opt_clean -purge

# write out
write_verilog gatelevel.gv
```

## Step 3. Download and Compile Jacquard

Download and install the Rust toolchain. This is as simple as a one-liner in your terminal. We recommend [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

Clone Jacquard along with its dependencies.
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/gpu-eda/Jacquard.git
cd Jacquard
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Jacquard supports two GPU backends: **CUDA** (NVIDIA GPUs on Linux) and **Metal** (Apple Silicon Macs).

All functionality is accessed through the `jacquard` CLI, which provides `sim`, `cosim`, `dump-paths`, and other subcommands:

``` sh
# Analyze timing / validate a netlist (no GPU features needed)
cargo run -r --bin jacquard -- dump-paths --help

# Simulation (Metal - macOS)
cargo run -r --features metal --bin jacquard -- sim --help

# Simulation (CUDA - Linux, requires CUDA toolkit)
cargo run -r --features cuda --bin jacquard -- sim --help
```

## Simulate the Design

Jacquard automatically partitions the design at startup using [mt-kahypar-sc](https://github.com/gzz2000/mt-kahypar-sc) hypergraph partitioning.

If partitioning fails due to deep circuits (which often shows as trying to partition a circuit with only 0 or 1 endpoints), try adding a `--level-split` option to force a stage split. For example `--level-split 30` or `--level-split 20,40`.

### Metal (macOS)

Use `NUM_BLOCKS=1` for Metal.

``` sh
cargo run -r --features metal --bin jacquard -- sim path/to/gatelevel.gv path/to/input.vcd path/to/output.vcd 1
```

### CUDA (Linux)

Replace `NUM_BLOCKS` with twice the number of physical streaming multiprocessors (SMs) of your GPU.

``` sh
cargo run -r --features cuda --bin jacquard -- sim path/to/gatelevel.gv path/to/input.vcd path/to/output.vcd NUM_BLOCKS
```

### VCD Scope Handling

Jacquard automatically detects the correct VCD scope containing your design's ports. In most cases, you don't need to specify `--input-vcd-scope`. If auto-detection fails or you need to override it, use:

``` sh
# Metal
cargo run -r --features metal --bin jacquard -- sim path/to/gatelevel.gv path/to/input.vcd path/to/output.vcd 1 --input-vcd-scope "testbench/dut"

# CUDA
cargo run -r --features cuda --bin jacquard -- sim path/to/gatelevel.gv path/to/input.vcd path/to/output.vcd NUM_BLOCKS --input-vcd-scope "testbench/dut"
```

Use slash separators (`/`) for hierarchical paths, not dots. See [troubleshooting-vcd.md](troubleshooting-vcd.md) for details.

The simulated output ports value will be stored in `output.vcd`.

**Caveat**: The actual GPU simulation runtime will also be outputted. You might see a long time before GPU enters due to reading and parsing `input.vcd`. You are recommended to develop your own pipeline to feed the input waveform into Jacquard's GPU kernels.

## Timing-Aware Simulation

Jacquard supports two ways to feed timing data into the simulator:

1. **`--timing-ir <path.jtir>`** — pre-converted Jacquard timing IR. This is the canonical path and requires no external tools at run time. Generate the IR ahead of time with the standalone `opensta-to-ir` tool (see `crates/opensta-to-ir/`).
2. **`--sdf <path.sdf> --liberty <path.lib>`** — raw SDF, converted to IR on the fly. This subprocesses [OpenSTA](https://github.com/parallaxsw/OpenSTA), which must be installed on the user's machine.

### OpenSTA dependency

When using `--sdf`, Jacquard locates OpenSTA in this order:

1. `JACQUARD_OPENSTA_BIN` environment variable.
2. `<repo-root>/scripts/build-opensta.sh --print-binary` (the canonical install path during development; the script builds the version vendored at `vendor/opensta/`).
3. `sta` on `PATH`.

Jacquard requires OpenSTA **3.1.0 or newer**, matching the commit pinned at `vendor/opensta/`. The pinned version is the only one with end-to-end test coverage; newer OpenSTA versions are accepted with a warning, older versions are a hard error.

The simplest way to get a known-good OpenSTA is to build the vendored copy from the Jacquard repo:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
./scripts/build-opensta.sh
```

Then either set `JACQUARD_OPENSTA_BIN` to the path printed by `./scripts/build-opensta.sh --print-binary`, or just let Jacquard find it automatically — the build script's output is searched by default.

### Error messages

| Symptom | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `--sdf requires OpenSTA: OpenSTA binary not found.` | OpenSTA isn't installed or isn't on PATH. | Run `./scripts/build-opensta.sh`, set `JACQUARD_OPENSTA_BIN`, or install OpenSTA system-wide. |
| `OpenSTA at <path> is v2.4.0; Jacquard requires v3.1.0 or newer.` | Installed OpenSTA is too old. | Rebuild from `vendor/opensta/` (which is pinned at 3.1.0) or upgrade your system OpenSTA. |
| `Detected OpenSTA v3.2.0, newer than the latest tested version v3.1.0.` (warning) | OpenSTA version is newer than what Jacquard's test corpus has been validated against. Simulation proceeds. | Report any timing discrepancies as bugs; we'll bump the tested-version range when CI catches up. |
| `--sdf requires --liberty <PATH>.` | OpenSTA needs the Liberty library to link the design. | Pass `--liberty <PATH>` alongside `--sdf`. |

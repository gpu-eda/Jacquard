# Jacquard Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Jacquard, a GPU-accelerated RTL logic simulator.

Use the sidebar to navigate between topics, or start with the [Getting Started](usage.md) guide.

## Documents

### Project Scope & Planning

Start here if you're considering a feature contribution or want to understand Jacquard's overall direction.

- **[Project Scope & Guarantees](project-scope.md)**: Top-level contract — what Jacquard is for, what it isn't, licensing and architecture constraints, stability tiers.
- **[Why Jacquard](why-jacquard.md)**: Honest positioning vs. STA tools and event-driven simulators; what's unique, what isn't, and what output interface would let users extract the value.
- **[Timing Correctness](timing-correctness.md)**: Scoped requirements for timing accuracy, validation, and the forthcoming timing IR.
- **[Timing Model Extensions](timing-model-extensions.md)**: Pre-spike design notes for δ(T) dynamic delay, clock-tree skew, and wire delay at scale. Formalised in ADR 0007.
- **[Post-Phase-0 Roadmap](plans/post-phase-0-roadmap.md)**: Sequencing of Phase 1+ work covering structured timing output (ADR 0008) and timing model fidelity (ADR 0007). (OpenTimer integration was originally Phase 1's centrepiece; ADR 0003 was Superseded by the spike — OpenSTA out of process is now the sole STA path per ADR 0001.)
- **[Architecture Decision Records](adr/README.md)**: Design decisions and their rationale (numbered, per-decision). See the index for status and how the ADRs relate.
- **[Implementation Plans](plans/README.md)**: Phased implementation plans with entry and exit criteria. See the index for status and reading order.
- **[Spikes](spikes/)**: Time-boxed experiments and their outcomes.

  - Data structures and representations
  - VCD input/output format requirements
  - Assertion and display support infrastructure
  - Performance characteristics
  - Known issues and limitations

- **[Timing Simulation](timing-simulation.md)**: CPU-based timing simulation with Liberty/SDF delays
- **[Timing Violations](timing-violations.md)**: GPU-side setup/hold violation detection

### Troubleshooting Guides

  - VCD hierarchy requirements
  - Signal naming and matching
  - Solutions for flat VCD generation
  - Diagnostic checklist
  - Working examples

## Quick Reference

### VCD Input Requirements (Critical!)

Jacquard expects VCD signals at **absolute top-level** (no module hierarchy):

```verilog
// ✓ Correct testbench
initial begin
    $dumpfile("output.vcd");
    $dumpvars(1, clk, reset, din, dout);  // Depth 1, explicit signals
end

// ✗ Incorrect testbench
initial begin
    $dumpfile("output.vcd");
    $dumpvars(0, testbench);  // Dumps entire hierarchy
end
```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Enable debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -r --features metal --bin jacquard -- sim <args>

# Verify with CPU simulation
cargo run -r --features metal --bin jacquard -- sim <args> --check-with-cpu

# Check VCD structure
grep '\$scope\|\$var' input.vcd | head -20
```

### Key Statistics

When running Jacquard, look for these diagnostic outputs:

```
netlist has X pins, Y aig pins, Z and gates        # AIG complexity
current: N endpoints, try M parts                  # Partition count
Built script for B blocks, reg/io state size S     # Final script
WARN (GATESIM_VCDI_MISSING_PI) ...                 # VCD issues!
```

## Investigation Methodology

This documentation was created through systematic investigation of Jacquard's behavior:

1. **Source Code Analysis**: Examined `src/aig.rs`, `src/flatten.rs`, `src/staging.rs`
2. **Debug Tracing**: Used `RUST_LOG=debug` to capture internal state
3. **Test Case Development**: Created minimal reproducible examples
4. **Comparative Testing**: Compared Jacquard vs iverilog outputs
5. **Third-Party Validation**: Tested with real-world examples (sva-playground)

## Known Issues Documented

1. **VCD Hierarchy Mismatch** (CRITICAL):
   - Jacquard expects flat VCD hierarchy
   - Most testbenches generate hierarchical VCDs
   - See troubleshooting-vcd.md for solutions

2. **Complex FSM Simulation**:
   - Some FSM designs don't simulate correctly
   - Under investigation (safe.v example in third_party tests)
   - May be related to synthesis optimization or reset handling

3. **Format String Preservation**:
   - Yosys may not preserve format attributes
   - Display messages show placeholders
   - Extract format strings from pre-synthesis JSON as workaround

## Contributing

When adding documentation:

1. **Be specific**: Include actual commands, file paths, code snippets
2. **Show examples**: Both working and non-working cases
3. **Link related docs**: Cross-reference other documentation files
4. **Date updates**: Update version and date at bottom of documents
5. **Test instructions**: Verify all commands actually work

## Future Documentation Needs

- [ ] Performance tuning guide (optimal `NUM_BLOCKS`, `--level-split`)
- [ ] Memory (SRAM) modeling and synthesis
- [ ] Custom cell library support beyond AIGPDK
- [ ] Multi-clock domain handling
- [ ] VCD scope option detailed behavior
- [ ] GPU kernel optimization internals

# Timing Simulation in GEM

> **See also:** [`timing-correctness.md`](timing-correctness.md) — forward-looking validation contract and timing IR requirements (in progress). The document below describes current behaviour.

This document explains GEM's boomerang evaluation architecture and how timing simulation with per-gate delays can be implemented efficiently on GPU.

## Current status (what ships today)

Phase 1 closed 2026-05-02; see [`plans/post-phase-0-roadmap.md`](plans/post-phase-0-roadmap.md).

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Liberty parsing | ✅ |
| SDF back-annotation via `opensta-to-ir` | ✅ |
| Per-DFF clock-arrival folding (Pillar B Stages 1+2) | ✅ |
| GPU-side setup/hold violation detection | ✅ Metal, CUDA, HIP (`sim`); the `cosim` path is a follow-up |
| **Symbolic violation messages** (`top/cpu/regs[7][bit 22] [word=42]`) | ✅ Metal, CUDA, HIP (`sim`) |
| **`--timing-report <path.json>`** structured end-of-run report | ✅ Metal, CUDA, HIP (`sim`); not yet wired for `cosim` |
| **`--timing-summary`** human-readable text summary | ✅ Metal, CUDA, HIP (`sim`); not yet wired for `cosim` |
| OpenSTA detection + version check | ✅ |
| Multi-corner timing IR (`--timing-corner <name>`) | ✅ |
| `--sdf-corner` (min/typ/max selection from one SDF) | ⚠ One corner at a time |
| Per-receiver wire delay (Pillar C Tier 1) | ❌ Phase 2 (blocked on ADR 0007) |

**What "HIP" means above.** HIP is two quite different things, and for most of
this project's life the table only ever meant the first:

- **HIP-over-CUDA** — `hip-runtime-nvidia`, built with the CUDA toolkit and
  executed on an NVIDIA GPU (`HIP Tests (NVIDIA backend)`, `tesla4-runner`).
  Source-compatible with CUDA and, in practice, CUDA semantics throughout.
- **HIP on real ROCm** — an actual AMD GPU (`HIP Tests (ROCm backend)`). This
  had never been built, let alone run, until 2026-07-15, and `sim` did not run
  there at all until the non-cooperative fallback landed: the device has no
  cooperative launch, so the grid-wide barrier `sim` relies on is unavailable
  and the host drives one launch per (cycle, stage) instead. See
  [`spikes/amd-laptop-backend.md`](spikes/amd-laptop-backend.md).

Both are now covered by CI and both pass, so the ✅s above are accurate for
each. The distinction still matters when reading a green tick: it is what hid
[#203](https://github.com/gpu-eda/Jacquard/issues/203) — an out-of-bounds read
that nvcc silently truncated back into range, so CUDA and HIP-over-CUDA were
accidentally *correct* while ROCm faulted. Arrival/violation arithmetic itself
is host-side Rust (#195) and therefore backend-independent.

See [`timing-violations.md`](timing-violations.md) for the full violation-output
interface and [`why-jacquard.md`](why-jacquard.md) for positioning.

## Background: The Simulation Challenge

GEM simulates And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) where every node is either:
- A **primary input** (value comes from VCD stimulus)
- An **AND gate** with two inputs (possibly inverted)

Traditional simulation evaluates gates in topological order, which is inherently serial. GPUs excel at massive parallelism - thousands of threads doing the same operation on different data. GEM bridges this gap with the **boomerang** architecture.

## Boomerang Evaluation

### Core Concept

The boomerang structure is a **hierarchical reduction tree** that maps an AIG onto GPU threads. It's called "boomerang" because data flows down the tree during reduction, then results are written back out at various levels - like a boomerang going out and returning.

### Hierarchy Structure

GEM uses `BOOMERANG_NUM_STAGES = 13`, meaning the tree has 2^13 = 8192 leaf positions:

```
Level 0 (inputs):   8192 positions
Level 1:            4096 positions  (8192 / 2)
Level 2:            2048 positions
Level 3:            1024 positions
Level 4:             512 positions
Level 5:             256 positions
Level 6:             128 positions
Level 7:              64 positions
Level 8:              32 positions
Level 9:              16 positions
Level 10:              8 positions
Level 11:              4 positions
Level 12:              2 positions
Level 13 (output):     1 position
```

Each level halves the number of positions by computing AND gates that combine pairs.

### Thread Organization

A GPU block has **256 threads** (`threadIdx.x` = 0..255). Each thread holds a **32-bit word** where each bit represents an independent Boolean signal:

```
Thread 0:   [bit0, bit1, bit2, ... bit31]  = 32 Boolean signals
Thread 1:   [bit0, bit1, bit2, ... bit31]  = 32 Boolean signals
...
Thread 255: [bit0, bit1, bit2, ... bit31]  = 32 Boolean signals
            ─────────────────────────────
            Total: 256 × 32 = 8192 signals per level
```

**Thread position** refers to `threadIdx.x` - which of the 256 threads we're addressing. Each thread position processes 32 signals in parallel using SIMD operations.

### Memory Layout

```cpp
__shared__ u32 shared_metadata[256];   // Partition configuration
__shared__ u32 shared_writeouts[256];  // Output staging area
__shared__ u32 shared_state[256];      // Working state (8192 bits)
```

The `shared_state` array holds the current level's values during reduction.

## The Reduction Process

### Phase 1: Level 0 → Level 1 (hier[0])

Only threads 128-255 are active. Each computes 32 AND gates in parallel:

```cpp
if(threadIdx.x >= 128) {
    u32 hier_input_a = shared_state[threadIdx.x - 128];  // From threads 0-127
    u32 hier_input_b = hier_input;                        // This thread's data

    // 32 AND gates computed simultaneously (one per bit)
    u32 ret = (hier_input_a ^ hier_flag_xora) &
              ((hier_input_b ^ hier_flag_xorb) | hier_flag_orb);

    shared_state[threadIdx.x] = ret;
}
```

The `xora`, `xorb`, and `orb` flags encode:
- `xora/xorb`: Input inversions (for AND-inverter graph)
- `orb`: Passthrough mode (when output equals input A, skip the AND)

Visual representation:
```
Before:  [T0][T1]...[T127] [T128][T129]...[T255]
              │                  │
              └───────┬──────────┘
                      │
                   AND gates (128 threads × 32 bits = 4096 gates)
                      │
                      ▼
After:   [----unused----] [T128][T129]...[T255]
                          (128 × 32 = 4096 results)
```

### Phase 2: Levels 1-3 (Shared Memory)

```cpp
for(int hi = 1; hi <= 3; ++hi) {
    int hier_width = 1 << (7 - hi);  // 64, 32, 16
    if(threadIdx.x >= hier_width && threadIdx.x < hier_width * 2) {
        u32 hier_input_a = shared_state[threadIdx.x + hier_width];
        u32 hier_input_b = shared_state[threadIdx.x + hier_width * 2];
        u32 ret = (hier_input_a ^ xora) & ((hier_input_b ^ xorb) | orb);
        shared_state[threadIdx.x] = ret;
    }
    __syncthreads();  // Barrier between levels
}
```

Each level activates fewer threads:
- Level 1: threads 64-127 (64 threads → 2048 gates)
- Level 2: threads 32-63 (32 threads → 1024 gates)
- Level 3: threads 16-31 (16 threads → 512 gates)

### Phase 3: Levels 4-7 (Warp Shuffle)

Within a single warp (32 threads), data exchange uses fast shuffle instructions instead of shared memory:

```cpp
if(threadIdx.x < 32) {
    for(int hi = 4; hi <= 7; ++hi) {
        int hier_width = 1 << (7 - hi);  // 8, 4, 2, 1
        u32 hier_input_a = __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, tmp_cur_hi, hier_width);
        u32 hier_input_b = __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, tmp_cur_hi, hier_width * 2);
        if(threadIdx.x >= hier_width && threadIdx.x < hier_width * 2) {
            tmp_cur_hi = (hier_input_a ^ xora) & ((hier_input_b ^ xorb) | orb);
        }
    }
}
```

No synchronization needed - warp shuffle is implicitly synchronized.

### Phase 4: Levels 8-12 (Bit Operations)

The final levels operate on bits within a single u32, computed by thread 0 only:

```cpp
if(threadIdx.x == 0) {
    // Level 8: 32 → 16 (operates on upper/lower halves)
    u32 r8 = ((v1 << 16) ^ xora) & ((v1 ^ xorb) | orb) & 0xffff0000;

    // Level 9: 16 → 8
    u32 r9 = ((r8 >> 8) ^ xora) & (((r8 >> 16) ^ xorb) | orb) & 0xff00;

    // Level 10: 8 → 4
    u32 r10 = ((r9 >> 4) ^ xora) & (((r9 >> 8) ^ xorb) | orb) & 0xf0;

    // Level 11: 4 → 2
    u32 r11 = ((r10 >> 2) ^ xora) & (((r10 >> 4) ^ xorb) | orb) & 0b1100;

    // Level 12: 2 → 1
    u32 r12 = ((r11 >> 1) ^ xora) & (((r11 >> 2) ^ xorb) | orb) & 0b10;

    tmp_cur_hi = r8 | r9 | r10 | r11 | r12;
}
```

### Write-Outs

Results are captured at various levels (not just the final output) and written to global memory:

```cpp
if((writeout_hook_i >> 8) == bs_i) {
    shared_writeouts[threadIdx.x] = shared_state[writeout_hook_i & 255];
}
```

This is the "return" part of the boomerang - results flow back from intermediate levels.

## Timing Simulation Approaches

### Approach Comparison

| Approach | Parallelism | Memory | Accuracy | GPU Fit |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------|---------|
| Event-driven | Poor (serial queue) | Low | Exact | Bad |
| Time-wheel | Medium | High | Configurable | Medium |
| **Levelized** | **Excellent** | **Low** | **Conservative** | **Best** |
| Oblivious | Maximum | Very High | Exact | Wasteful |

### Recommended: Levelized with Delay Accumulation

This approach piggybacks on the existing boomerang structure with minimal changes.

#### Data Structure Addition

```cpp
// Add to shared memory (256 bytes additional)
__shared__ u8 shared_arrival[256];  // One arrival time per thread position
```

Each thread position stores a single 8-bit arrival time representing the **maximum arrival across all 32 bits** in that position.

#### Modified AND Gate Evaluation

```cpp
// Current (value only):
u32 ret = (hier_input_a ^ xora) & ((hier_input_b ^ xorb) | orb);
shared_state[threadIdx.x] = ret;

// With timing (add ~4 instructions):
u32 ret = (hier_input_a ^ xora) & ((hier_input_b ^ xorb) | orb);
shared_state[threadIdx.x] = ret;

u8 arr_a = shared_arrival[threadIdx.x - offset_a];
u8 arr_b = shared_arrival[threadIdx.x - offset_b];
u8 arr_ret = min(max(arr_a, arr_b) + GATE_DELAY, 255);  // Saturating add
shared_arrival[threadIdx.x] = arr_ret;
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Same number of kernel launches** as zero-delay simulation
- **O(levels × cycles)** - identical to current
- **~256 bytes additional shared memory** per partition
- **Estimated 10-20% performance overhead**

## The Approximation Trade-off

### What We Track

One arrival time per thread position (256 values) instead of per signal (8192 values).

### Implications

If thread position 50 contains signals A, B, C with different true arrivals:
```
Signal A: 15ps (shortest path)
Signal B: 23ps (longest path)
Signal C: 8ps  (medium path)
```

We store only: `arrival[50] = 23ps` (the maximum).

### Why This Works

1. **Conservative**: We might report false violations, but never miss real ones
2. **Correlated signals**: Signals at the same thread position are often topologically nearby with similar timing
3. **Endpoint focus**: We ultimately only care about arrivals at DFF D inputs

### When Full Accuracy is Needed

For bit-accurate timing, you would need:
```cpp
// 8KB additional shared memory (may exceed limits)
__shared__ u8 shared_arrival[256][32];  // Per-bit arrivals
```

This is feasible but significantly increases memory pressure and computation.

## Conservative Timing Model: Sources of Overestimation

Jacquard's GPU timing is intentionally conservative — it may over-estimate arrival times
but will never under-estimate them. This is important for setup violation detection:
false positives are safe, false negatives would miss real bugs.

There are three independent sources of conservatism, each adding to the overestimate:

### Source 1: max(rise, fall) per cell

The GPU kernel tracks a single u16 arrival per thread position. It cannot distinguish
between rising and falling signal transitions because each thread processes 32 packed
Boolean signals simultaneously — there's no per-bit transition direction available.

**How it works**: For each cell, `inject_timing_to_script()` computes:
```rust
delay = max(gate_delays[pin].rise_ps, gate_delays[pin].fall_ps)
```

**Impact**: For the SKY130 inv_chain test (16 inverters), rise delays average ~10ps
larger than fall delays. In a real inverter chain, transitions alternate (rise→fall→rise),
so half the cells use the smaller fall delay. Jacquard uses the larger rise delay for all.

**Measured**: 80ps overestimate on 1235ps (6.5%) for 16 inverters with ~10ps rise/fall
asymmetry per cell.

### Source 2: max wire delay across all input pins

For multi-input cells (AND gates, MUXes), INTERCONNECT delays to different input pins
may differ significantly. Jacquard takes the maximum across all input pins:

```rust
// wire_delays_per_cell: dest_cellid → max(all input wire delays)
entry.rise_ps = entry.rise_ps.max(ic.delay.rise_ps);
entry.fall_ps = entry.fall_ps.max(ic.delay.fall_ps);
```

**Impact**: If an AND gate has input A arriving via a 10ps wire and input B via a
200ps wire, Jacquard assigns 200ps to the cell regardless of which input is on the
critical path. An event-driven simulator would correctly propagate the 10ps arrival
on input A independently.

**When this matters**: Designs with highly asymmetric routing (e.g., one input is
local, another crosses the chip). Well-routed designs typically have balanced wire
delays to multi-input cells.

### Source 3: max arrival across 32 packed signals per thread

Each thread position holds 32 independent Boolean signals. Jacquard tracks one arrival
per thread position (the maximum across all 32 signals):

```
Thread 50: [signal_A: 5ps, signal_B: 23ps, signal_C: 8ps, ...]
Tracked:   arrival[50] = 23ps (max of all 32)
```

**Impact**: If signals with very different timing are packed into the same thread,
the fastest signals inherit the slowest signal's arrival time.

**Mitigation**: The bit-packing algorithm can sort signals by estimated timing before
assignment (see "Timing-Aware Bit Packing" section). This keeps similar-timing signals
together, reducing the max approximation error.

### Combined Effect

These sources are multiplicative in the worst case. For the inv_chain test:

| Source | Contribution | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| max(rise, fall) | +80ps | 8 inverters × 10ps asymmetry |
| max wire delay | +8ps | 8 wires × 1ps asymmetry |
| max per thread | 0ps | Only 1 signal per thread in this test |
| **Total overestimate** | **88ps / 7.1%** | vs CVC transition-accurate result |

For larger designs with more routing asymmetry and denser bit packing, the combined
overestimate could be larger. The bit-packing sort (Source 3) is the most actionable
mitigation.

### CVC Reference Validation

The inv_chain design (2 DFFs + 16 SKY130 inverters) was validated against CVC
(open-src-cvc), an event-driven Verilog simulator with native SDF back-annotation:

```
CVC:  clk_to_q=350ps  chain=885ps  total=1235ps  (transition-accurate)
Jacquard: clk_to_q=350ps  chain=973ps  total=1323ps  (conservative max)
Difference: 88ps (7.1% overestimate)
```

Both simulators agree on CLK→Q delay (350ps) because the DFF has a single output
transition direction per clock edge. The chain delay differs because CVC tracks
actual rise/fall polarity through each inverter.

**To run the CVC comparison locally**:
```bash
bash tests/timing_test/cvc/run_cvc.sh
```
Requires Docker (builds CVC from source on first run).

## Delay Data Encoding

### Script Format

The existing boomerang section has padding that can store delay data:

```
Current format per thread per stage:
  [xora: u32]
  [xorb: u32]
  [orb:  u32]
  [padding: u32]  ← Can store delay here
```

### PackedDelay Structure

```rust
#[repr(C)]
pub struct PackedDelay {
    pub rise_ps: u16,  // Rising edge delay in picoseconds
    pub fall_ps: u16,  // Falling edge delay in picoseconds
}
```

For simplified timing, a single uniform delay constant can be used instead of per-gate delays.

## Timing Violation Detection

### At Each Cycle Boundary

The GPU kernel checks timing constraints per state word (32 signals) after the boomerang evaluation completes. Arrivals and constraints use **u16 picosecond** values (range 0–65535 ps). Arithmetic is performed in **u32** to avoid overflow when summing arrival + setup:

```cpp
// After boomerang completes, before next cycle
// arrival: u16 max accumulated delay for this 32-signal group
// constraint_word: packed [setup_ps:16][hold_ps:16]
u16 setup_ps = constraint_word >> 16;
u16 hold_ps  = constraint_word & 0xFFFF;

// Setup check: skip when arrival == 0 (no data propagated, e.g. first cycle
// or DFF with constant inputs)
if (arrival > 0 && (u32)arrival + (u32)setup_ps > clock_period_ps) {
    int slack = (int)clock_period_ps - (int)arrival - (int)setup_ps;
    write_event(event_buffer, EVENT_TYPE_SETUP_VIOLATION,
                cycle, io_offset + threadIdx.x,
                (u32)slack, (u32)arrival, (u32)setup_ps);
}

// Hold check: no arrival > 0 guard (hold violations matter even at cycle 0)
if ((u32)arrival < (u32)hold_ps) {
    int slack = (int)arrival - (int)hold_ps;
    write_event(event_buffer, EVENT_TYPE_HOLD_VIOLATION,
                cycle, io_offset + threadIdx.x,
                (u32)slack, (u32)arrival, (u32)hold_ps);
}
```

### Event Buffer Integration

```rust
pub enum EventType {
    Stop = 0,
    Finish = 1,
    Display = 2,
    AssertFail = 3,
    SetupViolation = 4,   // Timing events
    HoldViolation = 5,
}
```

For full details on interpreting violation reports and tracing violations to source signals, see [docs/timing-violations.md](timing-violations.md).

## Timing-Aware Bit Packing

### The Problem

Each thread position holds 32 signals packed into a u32. When tracking timing with one arrival value per thread position, we approximate all 32 signals as having the same arrival time (the maximum).

This approximation is accurate when signals in the same thread have similar timing. But the default placement algorithm uses **first-fit** for bit assignment:

```rust
// Default: first available slot
for i in 0..hier[selected_level].len() {
    if hier[selected_level][i] == usize::MAX {
        slot_at_level = i;  // First-fit, not timing-aware
        break;
    }
}
```

This can result in signals with very different timing sharing a thread:

```
Thread 50 (accidental grouping):
  bit 0: level 5,  ~5ps arrival
  bit 1: level 12, ~12ps arrival  ← 7ps difference!
  bit 2: level 6,  ~6ps arrival

Thread 50 (timing-aware grouping):
  bit 0: level 5, ~5ps arrival
  bit 1: level 5, ~5ps arrival    ← similar timing
  bit 2: level 6, ~6ps arrival
```

### Current Timing Correlation

The placement algorithm already computes **logic levels**:

```rust
// Level = max(level of inputs) + 1
level[node] = max(level[input_a], level[input_b]) + 1;
```

Logic level correlates with timing (more levels = more gate delays), but signals at the same level can still have different actual delays due to:
- Different gate types (AND2_00_0 vs AND2_11_1)
- Different wire loads
- Path reconvergence

### Solution: Sort by Timing Before Packing

Before assigning bit positions, sort signals by their estimated arrival time:

```rust
// Collect nodes at this level
let mut nodes_to_place: Vec<_> = candidates
    .filter(|n| level[n] == selected_level)
    .collect();

// Sort by arrival time (level as proxy, or actual timing if available)
nodes_to_place.sort_by_key(|n| arrival_estimate[n]);

// Place in sorted order - similar timing ends up in same thread
for (slot, node) in nodes_to_place.iter().enumerate() {
    place_bit(..., slot, *node);
}
```

### Alternative Approaches

| Approach | Complexity | Effectiveness | When to Use |
|----------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Sort by timing** | Low | Good | Default choice |
| Timing-aware partitioning | High | Best | Large designs |
| Post-placement swapping | Medium | Good | Fine-tuning |
| Timing bands | Low | Moderate | Simple heuristic |

### Timing Bands

Group signals into arrival time bands:

```
Band 0: 0-10ps   → Threads 0-63
Band 1: 10-20ps  → Threads 64-127
Band 2: 20-30ps  → Threads 128-191
Band 3: 30+ps    → Threads 192-255
```

### Measuring Packing Quality

Diagnostic to measure timing variance per thread:

```rust
fn analyze_timing_packing(hier: &Hierarchy, arrivals: &[u64]) {
    for thread in 0..256 {
        let times: Vec<_> = get_bits_in_thread(hier, thread)
            .map(|b| arrivals[b])
            .collect();

        let range = times.iter().max() - times.iter().min();
        let variance = compute_variance(&times);

        if range > threshold {
            warn!("Thread {} has {}ps timing spread", thread, range);
        }
    }
}
```

### Impact on Approximation Accuracy

With timing-aware packing:
- **Reduced false positives**: Fewer spurious timing violations from max approximation
- **Tighter bounds**: Per-thread arrival closer to actual signal arrivals
- **Better critical path identification**: Max arrival more accurately reflects true critical path

## Performance Expectations

| Metric | Zero-Delay | With Timing |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Kernel launches | N | N |
| Shared memory | 3KB | 3.25KB |
| Registers | ~32 | ~36 |
| Instructions/gate | ~5 | ~9 |
| **Estimated overhead** | - | **15-25%** |

The overhead is modest because:
1. Timing operations are simple (max, add)
2. Memory access pattern is identical
3. No additional synchronization needed
4. Same parallelism structure

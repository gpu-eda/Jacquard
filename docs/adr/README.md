# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs capture decisions worth understanding later: the context, the
options considered, and the rationale for the choice. They are
numbered, append-only, and never silently rewritten — if a decision
changes, supersede the old ADR with a new one and update the status.

## Status legend

- **Accepted / Approved** — current, in effect.
- **Proposed** — drafted, not yet ratified.
- **Superseded** — historical, replaced by a later ADR or by a spike
  outcome; kept for the audit trail.

## How the ADRs relate

- **0001 / 0003 / 0005 / 0006** describe the timing oracle stack:
  OpenSTA as the ground truth (0001), vendored at a pinned revision
  with its own corpus reused (0005), driving SDF preprocessing
  out-of-process (0006). The earlier OpenTimer in-process plan (0003)
  was retired after the spike ([`../spikes/opentimer-sky130.md`](../spikes/opentimer-sky130.md)).
- **0002** is the data contract those tools talk over — a JSON timing
  IR consumed by Jacquard, produced by `opensta-to-ir`.
- **0004** governs how PDK-specific testing happens for NDA-bound
  contributors without leaking files into the public repo.
- **0007 / 0008** are the forward-looking pair: 0008 (Approved)
  defines the structured timing output Jacquard owes downstream
  flows; 0007 (Proposed) sketches the model-fidelity work needed to
  back those outputs at scale (δ(T), clock-tree skew, wire delay).
  Scheduling for both lives in
  [`../plans/post-phase-0-roadmap.md`](../plans/post-phase-0-roadmap.md).

- **0013** documents the cosim peripheral model architecture (CPU-side
  `PeripheralModel` trait, GPU-side kernel functions, ring buffers)
  and establishes the `effective_*()` plural-config convention for
  multi-instance peripherals (UART first, then Flash/JTAG when
  needed). Plan doc:
  [`../plans/multi-peripheral-cosim.md`](../plans/multi-peripheral-cosim.md).

## Adding a new ADR

1. Pick the next number (highest existing + 1).
2. Filename: `NNNN-short-kebab-title.md`.
3. Start with `# ADR NNNN — <title>` and a `**Status:**` line.
4. Standard sections: Context, Decision, Consequences. Add Amendment
   blocks dated when the decision is revisited; do not rewrite
   accepted history.
5. Add the row to the table above.

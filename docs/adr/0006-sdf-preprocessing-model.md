# ADR 0006 — SDF preprocessing model and interim-to-release cutover

**Status:** Accepted 2026-04; amended 2026-05-02 (see § Amendment).

## Amendment (2026-05-02)

The original Decision treated subprocess invocation of OpenSTA from the shipped Jacquard runtime as license-incompatible, requiring Phase 3 (native Rust SDF→IR converter) to land before first release. On review of GPL-3 § 5 ("aggregate") and the FSF interpretation of subprocess/IPC boundaries, this restriction is more conservative than necessary. The relevant facts:

- The interface is arms-length: standard EDA interchange formats (Liberty / Verilog / SDF / SPEF / SDC) in, our own IR JSON (ADR 0002) out. No shared data structures, no headers, no linking.
- We do not bundle OpenSTA in any Jacquard distribution. The user installs OpenSTA themselves; user-side combination of separately-distributed programs is not "distribution of a combined work" under GPL-3.
- The original "no runtime subprocess" rule was effectively a commercial-perception buffer, not a strict licensing requirement.

**Revised bright lines** (these supersede the original "Shipped release" sub-section):

1. **No linking** of GPL code into the Jacquard binary. Unchanged.
2. **No bundling** of OpenSTA (or any GPL tool) in Jacquard distribution artefacts (release tarballs, Homebrew formulae, Docker images that ship as Jacquard releases). If a packager wants to bundle, they take on GPL distribution obligations themselves.
3. **Subprocess invocation of user-installed OpenSTA from the shipped runtime is permitted.** `jacquard sim input.sdf` may keep its `opensta-to-ir` subprocess hook in shipped releases, provided OpenSTA is discovered on PATH rather than bundled.

**Phase 3 reclassification.** Native Rust SDF→IR converter is no longer release-gating. It remains a goal — for ergonomics (no OpenSTA install required) and for downstream commercial integrators whose legal teams treat any GPL touchpoint as risk — but ships when bandwidth allows, not as a release blocker. Roadmap consequences are tracked in `../plans/post-phase-0-roadmap.md` § Phase 3.

**Corequisite — OpenSTA detection and version check (release-blocking).** Relaxing the no-runtime-subprocess rule is conditional on the shipped runtime giving users a meaningful error when OpenSTA is missing or out-of-date. Today (`src/sim/setup.rs:248-264`), missing OpenSTA only emits a `warn!` and the simulation proceeds with no timing data loaded — acceptable during development, ships as a UX bug. Concretely, before first release we must:

1. Hard-fail (not warn) when `--sdf` is requested and OpenSTA cannot be located.
2. Probe OpenSTA's version on first invocation and fail with a remediation message if it is older than the version pinned in `vendor/opensta/` (per ADR 0005).
3. Warn-but-proceed if the detected version is newer than the latest tested version, naming the version in the warning.
4. Document the OpenSTA dependency in `docs/synthesis-flow.md`.

Tracked as **WS-RH.1** in `../plans/post-phase-0-roadmap.md` § Release hardening.

**Code-comment cleanup follow-up.** The `INTERIM per ADR 0006` / `Pre-release only` tags in `src/sim/setup.rs` (lines ~176, ~228, ~286) and `src/bin/jacquard.rs` (~187) describe a premise that no longer applies. Folded into WS-RH.1 (`../plans/post-phase-0-roadmap.md` § Release hardening) rather than spun out as a separate cleanup commit.

The original Context, Decision (Phase 0 + Phase 3), and Walk-back sections below are retained for historical record. Where they conflict with the bright lines above, the bright lines win.

## Context

Jacquard's hand-rolled SDF parser (`src/sdf_parser.rs`) has accumulated reactive maintenance over time — empty `()` delays, `(COND …)` pin specs, escape handling, edge-qualified timing checks, TIMINGCHECK-stripping workarounds for OpenLane2 output. Each production failure has been a one-off patch. The timing-correctness review flagged this as issue #3, and a native Rust grammar-based replacement is the Phase 3 deliverable.

Concurrently, ADR 0001 establishes OpenSTA as the timing correctness oracle (subprocess, never linked, GPL), and ADR 0002 introduces a timing IR that decouples parsing from consumption.

Two facts together shape the decision:

1. **No release pressure.** Release can happen after Phase 3 lands. We are not forced to keep the hand-rolled parser alive while waiting on Phase 3.
2. **Permissive-license constraint applies to the shipped binary.** Subprocess invocation of GPL tooling is acceptable — does not trigger reciprocal obligations — and during pre-release development, even in-runtime subprocess invocation does not violate the constraint because no runtime binary is being distributed.

Given these, maintaining the hand-rolled parser through Phase 0–2 is unnecessary. OpenSTA's mature dialect coverage can substitute, via subprocess, while we build toward a native Rust replacement at our own pace.

## Decision

### Phase 0

- **Delete `src/sdf_parser.rs`** and the SDF→Jacquard-internal-types code path. All paths that previously consumed SDF now consume timing IR.
- **Ship `opensta-to-ir`** as a standalone preprocessing tool that consumes Liberty + Verilog + SDF + SPEF + SDC and emits timing IR. Subprocess-based on OpenSTA. Production-quality: stable CLI, documented exit codes, clear diagnostics.
- **Canonical runtime path** is `jacquard sim --timing-ir <path>`, consuming pre-converted IR. This path works without OpenSTA on the user's machine — pre-converted IR is sufficient.
- **Interim ergonomic path**: during development (pre-release only), `jacquard sim input.sdf` subprocesses `opensta-to-ir` internally to produce IR on the fly. This is a contributor convenience, not a shipping feature. Flag exists in code as `pre-release only` with a clear comment tying back to this ADR.

### Phase 3

- **Native Rust SDF→IR converter** replaces the OpenSTA subprocess call inside `jacquard sim input.sdf`. Grammar-based (nom / pest), validated against OpenSTA on the corpus per ADR 0001.
- Lands **before first release**.

### Shipped release

- **No OpenSTA invocation from the `jacquard` runtime binary.** The native Rust converter handles SDF inputs directly.
- **`opensta-to-ir` remains** as an alternative preprocessing tool. Users who want OpenSTA-computed timing may use it; subprocess model preserves permissive licensing.

### Walk-back options (if assumptions change)

- **If OpenSTA dialect coverage proves insufficient** during Phase 0 — e.g., a current Jacquard-supported SDF fails to parse — add dialect shims to `opensta-to-ir`'s post-processing. Reinstating the hand-rolled parser is the last resort, not the first.
- **If the Phase 3 Rust rewrite stalls** — ship the first release with preprocessing-only (no `jacquard sim input.sdf` path), remove the interim subprocess, and land the native converter in a later release. No information lost; users preprocess manually. This is already the post-release shape for `opensta-to-ir`; it's only the `jacquard sim input.sdf` convenience that would be deferred.
- **If OpenSTA becomes unmaintainable or disappears** — the submodule pin (ADR 0005) remains authoritative for the integrated version. A forked submodule can maintain any necessary patches.

## Consequences

- Jacquard's repository stops carrying a hand-rolled SDF parser as a reactive-maintenance target. Bugs in SDF interpretation between Phase 0 and Phase 3 are OpenSTA's problem (upstream) or `opensta-to-ir` post-processing's problem, not Jacquard's core codebase's problem.
- Pre-release ergonomic one-step workflow for contributors is preserved.
- Contributors running Jacquard on a *new* design (no pre-converted IR) must have OpenSTA installed during Phase 0 through Phase 3. For existing primary-corpus designs, pre-converted IR is checked in; no OpenSTA needed.
- Release-time check is unambiguous: either the runtime subprocess is replaced by native code, or it is removed entirely. Both outcomes satisfy the permissive-licensing constraint for the shipped binary.
- Test corpus regenerable: if OpenSTA updates change IR output, golden files are regenerated deliberately (reviewable diff), not silently.
